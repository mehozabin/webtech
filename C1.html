        <h2>How to make</h2>

        <h4>Step 1:</h4>

        <p margin: 5px 120px 45px 120px; font-size: 20px;>
                In a large skillet, in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or ghee) fry potatoes until brown, 
                drain and reserve the potatoes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onion, 
                garlic and ginger until onion is soft and golden. Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt and 
                the tomatoes. Fry, stirring constantly for 5 minutes. Add yogurt, mint, cardamom and cinnamon stick. 
                Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. 
                It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick 
                to the pan.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 2:</h4>

        <p margin: 5px 120px 45px 120px; font-size: 20px;>
                When the mixture is thick and smooth, add the chicken pieces and stir well to coat 
                them with the spice mixture. Cover and cook over very low heat until the chicken is 
                tender, approximately 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy 
                left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to 
                reduce the gravy.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 3:</h4>

        <p margin: 5px 120px 45px 120px; font-size: 20px;>
                Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 4:</h4>

        <p margin: 5px 120px 45px 120px; font-size: 20px;>
                In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil (or ghee) and fry the onions until they are golden. 
                Add saffron, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, ginger and rice. Stir continuously until the 
                rice is coated with the spices.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 5:</h4>

        <p margin: 5px 120px 45px 120px; font-size: 20px;>
                In a medium-size pot, heat the chicken stock and salt. When the mixture is hot pour it over the 
                rice and stir well. Add the chicken mixture and the potatoes; gently mix them into the rice. Bring 
                to boil. Cover the saucepan tightly, turn heat to very low and steam for 20 minutes. Do not lift lid 
                or stir while cooking. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
